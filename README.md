Our Project is a parking mananger that can manage the specified parking in the description.


## Tools
- Verilog (Using its reg and wire)

    1.Define modules for entry, exit, and parking management.
    2.Use registers and counters for total spaces (700) and available staff/visitor spaces.
    3.Implement priority logic to allocate spots to staff first, then visitors.
    4.Integrate clock-driven updates for dynamic staff capacity adjustment.
    5.Use sensors and flags to detect car presence and update counters.
